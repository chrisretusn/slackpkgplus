# Enable (on) / Disable (off) a Strict GPG Check. A repository should contains packages signed
# with the only original GPG-KEY. In some custom repository may be wanted to mix heterogeneous

# If two or more repositories contains some same packages, you can specify

# The syntax is "<repository_name>:<package_name>"
# Accepts regular expressions. To give priority to an entire repository use "<repository_name>"

# Examples:
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( restricted:vlc )
# OR
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( myrepo )
# 
# if you have two repositories to give priority you must set both in the same line
#PKGS_PRIORITY=( myrepo restricted:vlc )
#

# Otherwise you can try to upgrade a package from a repository that contains a package with the
# same tag of the already installed package. Typically that means to upgrade a package from the
# same author of the already installed package.
# Note that this method may not works properly where two repositories contains a package with the
# same tag.
